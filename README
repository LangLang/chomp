          LangLang - Chomp
  -------------------------------
  "It's turtles all the way down"

Chomp is a compiler/interpreter for the LangLang - a symbolic/homoiconic/declarative style
language-language. In fact LangLang is many things, perhaps most obviously a programming language,
but also a templating/schema language, a data format and a proof calculus amongst other things.
For this reason Chomp also fills many roles, however our initial goal is bootstrapping a compiler
for developing tools inside the language.

Chomp is open source, licensed under the permissive MIT license.
